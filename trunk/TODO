TODO

Documentation

* Fill the web layout of the design documentation


Gui

* Check file open, save, save as implementation
* When the user press Key.Up in the Command Entry this one should not lost the focus.
---
* Add Gtk.ToolTipsData tooltips over the main text that shows the author of a paragraph. 


ConcurrentEditableWidget

* Reenable use of SourceView, disabled because of Gtk 1.0/2.0 compilation issues, has to be solved. Disabling is just a workarround (how does Monodev solve this issue ?)
---
* Trigger flush when finishing a word or a phrase, slowdown the automatic flush timer
* How to avoid tags to copied when copy and paste ? (has to manage the clipboard data reception or the TextBuffer.PasteClipboard)


Network

* When loading the document, the download should show a progress bar. How to this in a remoting schema ? How does the design have to be modified ?
   

ConcurrentEditable

* Write more tests


Chalks

* When the window is close, the program does not quit (need double click to quit)

 
Deployment

* Choose the build system
	- nAnt: brings Ant, a standard on the Java world to .NET
	- Traditional Makefile
	- A-A-P (http://www.a-a-p.org/): Traditional Makefile on steroids
	
* Choose the distribution system
	- Nullsoft installer for Windows system: GPL and easy to use.
	- Let's keep a dist-<platform> file for each one. I'm cheking in the -win one which 
	  builds a .exe binary installer/uninstaller. 
	- For nix platforms, I believe we just need to build a tar.gz archive with full sources
	  (that could be a nAnt "src" target). After some time maintainers from *nix distributions 
	  may create binary packages for us adhering to their proper standards.
