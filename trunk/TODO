Documentation

* Fill the web layout of the design documentation


Gui

* Colored nicknames does not work in both senses (there is a bug)
* Check file open, save, save as implementation
* Put set password dialog into the preferences
* The current file name should appear in the window title
* How to change tabs by spaces ?
* Link the Connection section of the Preferences dialog to an underlying action
* Disconnect dialog should show how many users are connected to you
---
* Add Gtk.ToolTipsData tooltips over the main text that shows the author of a paragraph. 


ConcurrentEditableWidget

* Solve the "delete_text" implementation error
* Reenable use of SourceView, disabled because of Gtk 1.0/2.0 compilation issues, has to be solved. Disabling is just a workarround (how does Monodev solve this issue ?)
---
* Trigger flush when finishing a word or a phrase, slowdown the automatic flush timer
* How to avoid tags to copied when copy and paste ? (has to manage the clipboard data reception or the TextBuffer.PasteClipboard)


Network

* how other modules (gui) are supposed to know if collaborating or not? (how they know when connection is lost ?)
* Chalks blocks at start if internet is not available
* ZeroConf support
* Have to implement the propagation of the "user has quited the session" event
* Have to implement the propagation of the "nickname change" event
* When loading the document, the download should show a progress bar. How to this in a remoting schema ? How does the design have to be modified ?

* Finish redo has a horrible bug implementation
* Write a test for generate_undo
* Write more tests


Chalks
