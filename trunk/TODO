Documentation

* Fill the web layout of the design documentation


Gui

* Colored nicknames does not work in both senses (there is a bug)
* Check file open, save, save as implementation
* Implement set password dialog
---
* Add Gtk.ToolTipsData tooltips over the main text that shows the author of a paragraph. 


ConcurrentEditableWidget

* Solve the "delete_text" implementation error
* Reenable use of SourceView, disabled because of Gtk 1.0/2.0 compilation issues, has to be solved. Disabling is just a workarround (how does Monodev solve this issue ?)
---
* Trigger flush when finishing a word or a phrase, slowdown the automatic flush timer
* How to avoid tags to copied when copy and paste ? (has to manage the clipboard data reception or the TextBuffer.PasteClipboard)


Network

* Chalks blocks at start if internet is not avialable
* ZeroConf support
* Have to implement the propagation of the "user has quited the session" event
* Have to implement the propagation of the "nickname change" event
* When loading the document, the download should show a progress bar. How to this in a remoting schema ? How does the design have to be modified ?
   

ConcurrentEditable

* Finish undo implementation
* Write a test for generate_undo
* Write more tests


Chalks

-- no pending tasks --

	- Tar.gz of compiled .Net program
	- Tar.gz of full sources
